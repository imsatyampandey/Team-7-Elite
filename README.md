## Problem statement
Develop an android app that can show the consolidated recent news from different
news channels and allow the user to read the full story by visiting the relevant
websites.

### Introduction 

Reading news from a conventional newspaper is, let's be honest, obsolete and troublesome. Our lifestyle demands consuming news on the get-go, and in a short & sweet way. And, the only two amenities you have available to yourself at all times are your cell phone and internet service. 
That's exactly why an app that summons news curated to your interests that are available across the W3; proves as a smart, futuristic and much more efficient choice.

This project aims to solve or at least mitigate this problem by fetching news from different sources and placing it in one consolidated mobile app.
